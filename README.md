# Loan Application Prediction Model

This project implements a loan application prediction model using a decision tree classifier. The goal of the model is to determine whether a loan application should be approved or not based on various input features.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset that contains historical loan application data. Each instance in the dataset represents a loan application and includes several features such as income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, etc. The dataset also includes a target variable that indicates whether the application was approved or not.

## Prerequisites

Before running the model, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python or Anaconda
- Pandas (version 1.4.2)
- Scikit-learn (version 1.0.2)

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the loan application prediction model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
